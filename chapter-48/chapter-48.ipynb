    "We illustrate the operation of the TD(0) algorithm (44.4) by reconsidering the earlier grid problem from Fig 44.4; we reproduce the grid in Fig.48.1 for ease of reference. The figure shows a grid with $16$ squares labeled $\\#1$ through $\\#16$. Four squares are special; these are squares $\\#4, \\#8, \\#11,$ and $\\#16$. Square $\\#8$ (danger) and $\\#16$ (stars) are terminal states. If the agent reaches one of these terminal states, the agent moves to an EXIT state and the game stops. The agent collects either a reward of $+10$ at square $\\#16$ or a reward of $-10$ at square $\\#8$. The agent collects a reward of $-0.1$ at all other states. \n",

    "There is an implicit assumption that, for this selection of feature vectors, the state--value function $v^{\\pi}(s)$ can be well  approximated by a linear functional of the form $h^{\\sf T} w^o$, for some weight vector $w^o$. This assumption is not always true and different constructions for the feature vectors would lead to different approximations for the state--value function. To illustrate this effect, we evaluate $v^{\\pi}(s)$ in two ways for comparison purposes. In the first method, we assume knowledge of the MDP parameters $\\{\\pi(a|s), {\\cal P}(s,a,s')\\}$ and compute the true  $v^{\\pi}(s)$ by using the Poisson equation (44.72) with $\\gamma=0.9$; the computer code determines $\\{r^{\\pi},P^{\\pi}\\}$ and finds $v^{\\pi}(s)$. We listed these values earlier in (46.55). In the second method, we employ the TD(0) algorithm (48.11) using the above feature construction and run it over $20,000$ episodes using the constant step-size value $\\mu=0.01$ and setting $v_{-1}^{\\pi}(s)$ to random initial values. Figure 48.2 plots the estimated state--values. It is clear from this simulation that the feature vectors used in (48.13)  are not well-representative of the evolution of the game. \n",

    "We consider next a more extreme construction for the feature vectors by relying on a hot-encoded representation, where $h$ now has dimensions $17\\times 1$ with the $j$th entry of $h$ set to $1$ if the agent is located at the $j$th square and $0$  otherwise; the only exception is the last row of $H$ corresponding to the EXIT state $s=17$, where the feature vector is all $0$. We can view this construction as taking a screen-shot of the game and identifying the location of the agent in the image. Constructions of this type are viable only for small state-space dimensions; otherwise, one needs to resort to reduced feature representations. In this way, we end up with the new feature matrix:\n",

    "We employ the same one-hot encoded feature vectors (48.14) from Example 48.1. As explained in that example, the feature vectors do not incorporate a constant bias value of $+1$ since the state value function at the EXIT state $s=17$ is zero, i.e., $v^{\\pi}(17)=0$. For this reason, we will only be training the weight parameters $\\{W_{\\ell}\\}$ for the network layers; there is no need for the offset parameters $\\{\\theta_{\\ell}\\}$ for this example. The input layer has $M=17$ neurons while the output layer has $|\\mathbb{A}|=5$ neurons. The two hidden layers have $n_2=32=n_3$ neurons each. We train the network using $E=50,000$ episodes and batches of size $B=1$ (single samples). For each episode, we generate a random state $s$ (and the corresponding feature $h_s$), and update the parameters of the network using constructions (48.115) and \n",

Subsequently, we move from $s$ to a new state $s'$ using an $\\epsilon-$greedy exploration policy with $\\epsilon=0.1$ and feed $s'$ (i.e., its feature vector $h_{s'}$) into the network, and repeat this process until the end of the episode. We continue to the next episode and so forth. \\\\\n",
