    "This result illustrates the piecewise linear nature of $v_{2}^{\\star}(b)$, as was the case with the previous iterate $v_1^{\\star}(b)$. The resulting function is plotted in Fig. 45.4. It is sufficient to illustrate the calculations for the first two steps. The value iterations can be continued for several steps from here as desired. It is clear that the complexity of the computations grows with the iterations as more segmentation of the probability range becomes necessary in order to describe the successive belief value functions.
