# E3-python-code-2023

This repository should contain the code and generated figures relative to the simulation examples presented in the following books:

*A. H. Sayed, Inference and Learning from Data, Vol. I. Cambridge University Press, 2022.* (**Saba**)

*A. H. Sayed, Inference and Learning from Data, Vol. II. Cambridge University Press, 2022.* (**Eduardo**)

*A. H. Sayed, Inference and Learning from Data, Vol. III. Cambridge University Press, 2022.* (**Semanur**)

The codes should take the form of Jupyter Notebooks, containing the same text description of the book for context. Inside each chapter folder, each example should have one Jupyter Notebook showing the simulation results reported in the book together with the generated figures. Furthermore, the resulting figures should be saved as separate files in the chapter folder.

Any content related to this internship (MATLAB codes, Jupyter Notebook codes, generated figures, notebook text) should by no means be shared or published without the authorization of Prof. Ali H. Sayed.
