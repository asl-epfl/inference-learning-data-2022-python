# E3-python-code-2023

This repository should contain the code and generated figures relative to the examples contained in the following books:

*Sayed, Ali H., Inference and Learning from Data, Vol. 1-3. Cambridge University Press, 2022.*

The codes should take the form of jupyter notebooks, containing the same text description of the book for context. Within each chapter folder, each example should have one jupyter notebook showing the simulation results reported in the book including the figures. Furthermore, the resulting figures are saved as separate files in the chapter folder.
